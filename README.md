# STM32NucleoF401RE_Sensitive_Vibration_Sensor

<b>Your project is an STM32F4 microcontroller application that reads data from a vibration sensor and transmits it over UART. The data from the sensor is converted to a digital value using an ADC (analog-to-digital converter). This digital value is then transmitted using a UART (universal asynchronous receiver-transmitter).

<h2>The project consists of the following steps:</h2>

Initialization of ADC and UART: In this step, the necessary settings for ADC and UART are made.
Reading data from the vibration sensor: The ADC converts the analog voltage from the vibration sensor to a digital value.
Converting the vibration value to Hertz: The value read from the ADC is converted to a vibration value in Hertz.

<h2>Transmission of the vibration value over UART: The vibration value is transmitted using the serial communication port over UART.
The project works as follows:</h2>

After the microcontroller is initialized, the ADC and UART are initialized.
The microcontroller uses the ADC to read data from the vibration sensor.
The read value is converted to a vibration value in Hertz.
The vibration value is transmitted using the serial communication port over UART.

<h2>The project can be used in the following applications:</h2>

Monitoring the vibration of machines and equipment
Earthquake detection systems
Monitoring the vibration of motor vehicles
